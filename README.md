# 2021-Social-Work-Project

## Purpose

This repository contains the 2021 Social Work Project for my Bachelor of Mathematics. The purpose emerged from the interest that some professors showed for alternatives in teaching and education. My approach was writing a few scripts in Python with the Manim Community library. So then I designed some mathematical animations in order to provide some resources to Calculus courses in the Autonomous University of Ciudad Ju√°rez.
The focus of these tools is based on showing the different approaches for learning mathematical concepts so that students can handle and organize the content in meaningful different ways.

## Concepts

1. Convergence of sequences
2. Stokes Theorem
3. Composition rule of functions
4. Level Curves of functions of several variables
