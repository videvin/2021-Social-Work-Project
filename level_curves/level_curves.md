## Level Curves


## Goal

To meet a level curves' description to graphic representation of surfaces

## General Description

1. We assume the graphic representation of two-variable functions

2. Lets define level curves as alternative ways to make a picture of the function

3. Spliting representation in two different axis

4. Join both representation in a single one that we can manipulate 

## Specific Description

1.
