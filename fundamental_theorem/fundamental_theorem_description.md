## Goal

Our current goal is to provide a description of our main tool in basic Calculus courses: the existence of antiderivates for continuous functions. We claim its status for the many functions with no antiderivates by simple examples.

## General Description

1. We know the definition of integral and derivative of a function. How to find an integral of simple functions (I mean, elementary functions)?

2. We introduce our function star that motivates the relationship between derivatives and integrals

3. We enunciate the first theorem through a picture

4. Our main tool is to be derived for calculating antiderivates, and then definite integrals

5. We make our last claim that lets us to find antiderivatives of integrable functions instead of continuous ones

6. Non-elementary functions are presented to show the limits of the Fundamental Theorem

## Specific description

1. Lets put out a question to answer

2. We define the function along with a cartesian depiction

3. Crafting an animation that connects the derivates and integrals

4. Ultimately, lets enunciate the propositions by animating distinct elements among the theorems

6. We show some functions that don't have antiderivative
