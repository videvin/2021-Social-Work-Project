## Overall goal

To describe the convergence of a sequence as an object derived from the fact that it's usually represented as an infinite process 

## General description 

1. Describe the behaviour of a sequence and look for the need of convergence to explicity draw the meaningful concept

2. Describe why we are using absolute values in the description of distances between numbers

3. Pointing out the formal definition of convergence

4. Driving the simple examples to the most tricky ones in order to show the consistency of the definition

5. Move on as object with properties, so we can make up sets of limits


## Specific descriptions

1. Lets take a look to the sequence 1/n^2. We're going to draw cartesian coordinates with intervals of the domain and range of the sequence. So, lets take particular points and check the behaviour of the points around a real number called "the limit of the sequence".

2. Then, we delineate points in the real line and how defining the distance between them.

3. We write the formal definition and specify the important details involved in the sentence (e.g. quantifiers, sets, etc.)

4. Reformulate the previous example by the new definition and try a trickier one

5. Move on to show a limit as an object. This can be done through the use of some properties. This has to force the student to think the limit as a new object, rather than a process. We conconct a set of limits with the next form lim = {l in R | such that l = lim f(x) for x in [0,2]}, lets take lim2 = {t in R | such that t = lim f(x) for x in [0,5]} What is lim2 intersection lim1?
