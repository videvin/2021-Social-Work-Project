## Goal

Our goal aims to deliver a precise and more comprehensive concept about functions defined in terms of another functions.

## General description

1. Lets take an specific function and make some transformations to its form

2. We will show how the domain and range change over this new formulation

3. It's important to describe the analytic evaluation of these objects

4. A graphic interpretation of this particular function is shown

5. A generic graphic image of this kind of functions is built over the old one

## Specific description

1. Let be f(x) = x**2 our function, and we ask how the function changes when it takes values of another function. But first, what it changes on the domain.

2. Lets give some graphic descriptions of easy-going transformations of the functions f(x) = x**2 and g(x) = 2*x

3. We define our abstraction and how the calculations look like

4. Portraying the objects through general graphs
