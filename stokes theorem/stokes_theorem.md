## Stoke's Theorem

## Goal

The Stoke's theorem shows the relationship between a line integral over an oriented curve and a line integral along a closed curve that makes up the boundary of the surface, so out objective is to provide the basic steps to make the assimilation


## General description

1. Lets show the general description of the concept

2. We compare the problem with ordinary line integrals

2. We bring an example

3. As soon as we finish the basic description, we are going to give the physical interpretation of the problem

## Specific description

1. Lets try to calculate the surface integral of an example by using stokes theorem, but first off showing how difficult the analytic methods of line integral are for these kinds of problem

2. Lets bring an example of the calculation

3. We bring up a physical problem that involves the Stoke's theorem
